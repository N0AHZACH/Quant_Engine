## 💎 Core Methodology

The system implements a **selective, cross-sectional strategy** that focuses on capital survival and consistent compounding through strict drawdown controls.

-   **Asset Universe**: NSE Equities (selected from a survivorship-bias aware universe).
-   **Trading Style**: Cross-sectional & Market-neutral components.
-   **Holding Period**: Fixed **3 trading days**.
-   **Prediction Target**: `log(Close[t+3] / Close[t])` (3-day log-returns).
-   **Objective**: 30% CAGR with a maximum drawdown limit of 15–20%.

The engine is modularized into specialized layers for high maintainability and performance:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`src/`** | Core library containing model training, feature engineering, and data preprocessing. |
| **`live/`** | Deployment scripts for live trading and portfolio monitoring. |
| **`production/`** | The "Production-Ready" engine including risk management, ensemble predictors, and decision engines. |
| **`engine/`** | Specialized logic for the backtester and core loading mechanisms. |
| **`docs/`** | Comprehensive architectural and development documentation. |
